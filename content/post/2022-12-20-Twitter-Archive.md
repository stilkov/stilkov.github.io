Iâ€™ve created <a href="/twitter">an online archive of my Twitter content</a>, using
[Tweetback](https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback), a tool that turns
your [exported data](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-twitter-archive)
into a self-contained, searchable, nicely rendered repository suitable
for inclusion on your own site. Probably useful mostly to myself, as I
often find myself remembering that I linked to something in a Tweet
rather than the exact details. It also feels good to own this data
again, no matter how irrelevant most it may seem.
