It’s hard to believe even for myself, but for quite some time (from 2003 until 2010), I was a very regular “blogger” (Don’t laugh! Yes, we did use that label unironically back then.) I’ve tried multiple times to restart the habit, but managed only 30 posts from 2011 to 2017. For now, I maintain all of my posts from back then [in an archive](https://www.innoq.com/blog/st/) over on the innoq.com main site, under the original URI.
